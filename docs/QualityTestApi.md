# **bulk_delete_quality_tests**
> bulk_delete_quality_tests(bulk_delete_quality_tests_request)

Delete multiple quality tests

Bulk deletes quality tests, either:
- All quality tests on a given `line` whose `timsetamp` is between `start_time` and `end_time`
OR
- All quality tests whose `id` is supplied

It will do one or the other, with a bias for `id`'s if both are supplied.


### Example

* Api Key Authentication (APIKeyAuth):

```python
import oden
from oden.models.bulk_delete_quality_tests_request import BulkDeleteQualityTestsRequest
from oden.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.oden.app
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = oden.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.oden.app"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: APIKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['APIKeyAuth'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['APIKeyAuth'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with oden.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = oden.QualityTestApi(api_client)
    bulk_delete_quality_tests_request = oden.BulkDeleteQualityTestsRequest() # BulkDeleteQualityTestsRequest | 

    try:
        # Delete multiple quality tests
        api_instance.bulk_delete_quality_tests(bulk_delete_quality_tests_request)
