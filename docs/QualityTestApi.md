# **v2_quality_schema_search_post**
> v2_quality_schema_search_post(quality_schema)

Searches for Quality Schema[s] by:

- `factory`


### Example

* Api Key Authentication (APIKeyAuth):

```python
import oden
from oden.models.quality_schema import QualitySchema
from oden.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.oden.app
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = oden.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.oden.app"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: APIKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['APIKeyAuth'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['APIKeyAuth'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with oden.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = oden.QualityTestApi(api_client)
    quality_schema = {"factory":{"name":"Factory A"}} # QualitySchema | 

    try:
        api_instance.v2_quality_schema_search_post(quality_schema)
